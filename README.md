# C HTTP Server
Something I did to learn the basics of an HTTP server and practice C!

## Dependencies

```bash
For Compiling:
WS2_32.Lib
pthreadVC3.lib
```

```bash
Inside .exe folder:
pthreadVC3.dll
```

## ETC.

Put the "http" folder that's inside the src directory on the same folder as the compiled .exe!
